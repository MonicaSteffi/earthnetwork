#  Earth microbial network project

The repository provides R script for the microbial network analysis of the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP).

## Dataset preparation 

### abundance table from the EMP

We then extracted 14 count matrices for 14 environmental categories at level-3 of the EMP ontology (Table S1) from the 90-bp Deblur BIOM table. We filtered the OTUs with relative abundance less than 0.001% and presenting in less than 10% of samples in corresponding count matrices of environments.

### Trimmed dataset

We kept 400 top-abundant ESVs and randomly selected 360 samples in the trimmed microbial community matrices. 

## Network inference
